<p> <i>Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He is best known by the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2 (which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation"). He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the evolution of quantum theory.

Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern (1902–1909), Switzerland. However, he realized that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields and—with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916—he published a paper on general relativity.

Einstein visited New York City for the first time on 2 April 1921, where he received an official welcome by Mayor John Francis Hylan, followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions. He went on to deliver several lectures at Columbia University and Princeton University, and in Washington he accompanied representatives of the National Academy of Science on a visit to the White House. On his return to Europe he was the guest of the British statesman and philosopher Viscount Haldane in London, where he met several renowned scientific, intellectual and political figures, and delivered a lecture at King's College London.

<h1><i><center><strong>Hardships faced by Einstein</strong><i></center></h1>

<div class="box">
<p><i> Einstein’s work came at a very steep cost. He had to divorce his wife, and lose his children. He was also alone in his theoretical work, but only he remained convinced that his work was right.

Years into his research, Einstein became mentally and physically ill. The enormous amount of stress had really taken a toll onto his health. He felt extremely exhausted, and very unhappy. To make matters worse, World War Two breaks out, and his years and years of research is put on a halt. Since Einstein was a German-Jew, Einstein’s safety was also at risk.</i> </p>
